# Architectural Organization

* Factory
  * Core
    * Utils
    * Widgets
    * Body
      * Tools
      * Main Pane
        * Timeline (X Axis)
        * Rows
          * Row
            * Chart Panes - Primary (price / candles), Secondary (indicators)
              * Price Scale (Y Axis)
              * Graph
                * Overlays
                  * Grid
                  * Cursor
                  * Price Line
                  * Candles
                  * Volume
                  * Technical Indicators
                  * User Defined

Most of these features can be accessed externally, e.g.:

```javascript
chart.secondaryPane.entries().next().value[1]
```

Although it is recommended that you use the API to modify the chart or respond to events.

## Factory

The static factory class is used to instantiate (multiple) chart instances. It registers the chart WebComponent.

## Core

The core starts the cascade of chart component creation. It provides:

* Internal and external API
* State management
* Event messaging
* Chart Data State
  * Validation
  * Export
  * Range handling - data subset
* Configuration
* Themes


# Patterns

**Hook Observer Pattern**  
An extensible API like WordPress, making it easy for third-party programmers to write extensions to the core.

**Aspect-Oriented Programming**  
Code injection into existing functions or objects, without modifying the target logic.

**State Machine**  
Logical state management providing a behavior model describing the states the system can be in and the conditions by which one transitions to another.

**Global Store**  
Centralized data management.

**Event Hub**  
Centralized event messaging system.

**Scalable Application Architecture**  
Decoupled, event-driven architecture.

**Model Controller View**  
Separation of concerns pattern.

## Aspect-Oriented Programming

Code injection into existing functions or objects without modifying the target logic.

## State Machine

Logical finite state management.

## Scalable JavaScript Application Architecture

Decoupled, event-driven architecture.

The features of the architecture are decoupled, allowing for flexible and extensible applications. The application is broken down into the following parts:

* Modules (sandboxed)
* Mediator (API)
* Application Core (Plugins, Base Libraries)

![Scalable Javascript Applicaton Architecture]../../../assets/architecture.png)

#### Module

Modules are single-purpose parts of a larger system that are interchangeable. They are classes which will be instantiated with a Mediator which will sand box them.

References: [1]

#### Sandbox

A Sandbox is a module instance created with the Mediator, which presents a siloed API of the Core for the Module. None of the modules can directly mutate each other or the Core.

The Sandbox uses a [Facade](#facade) [2] and [Mediator](#mediator<a id="application-core"></a>) [3] pattern.

Modules can interact with the Core and each other via the Mediator which has inheirited a specific methods and properties ([Facade](#facade)) from the Core.

#### Mediator

The Mediator can be thought of as a customized API for the Core (Facade).

#### <a id="application-core"></a>Core

The Core is responsible for starting and stopping the modules. It also handles the messages by using the [Publish/Subscribe (Mediator) pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern).

#### Plugins

Plugins extend or mofify the functionality of the Core.

### Design Patterns

#### <a id="facade"></a>Facade

The Facace is a unifying (simplified) API for the [Application Core](#application-core).

It serves as an **abstraction** of the application core which sits between the mediator and our modules - it should ideally be the **only** other part of the system modules are aware of.

In that way you can hide the features provided by the core and only show a well defined custom static long term API to your modules.

References: [2]

#### <a id="mediator"></a>Mediator

A mediator **encapsulates** how disparate modules **interact**
with each other by acting as an intermediary. The pattern also promotes
loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other
explicitly - in our system, this helps to solve our module
inter-dependency issues.

It provides the Facade to Module, by extending the Module class.

# Modules

## Module Template

```javascript
// optional State Machine
// import stateMachineConfig from "../state/state-chart"

export default class UtilsBar {

  #modID                 // required - set by the Core
  #name = "Utilities"    // required
  #shortName = "utils"   // required
  #mediator              // required
  #options               // required

  // user defined properties follow...

  // required - can be empty
  constructor (mediator, options) {

    this.#mediator = mediator
    this.#options = options
    this.init()
  }

  // suggested
  log(l) { this.#mediator.log(l) }
  info(i) { this.#mediator.info(i) }
  warn(w) { this.#mediator.warn(w) }
  error(e) { this.#mediator.error(e) }

  // required
  get name() {return this.#name}
  // required
  get shortName() {return this.#shortName}
  // required
  get mediator() {return this.#mediator}
  // required
  get options() {return this.#options}

  init() {
    this.mount(this.#elUtils)
  }

  // required
  start() {
    // Start the module's activities.
    // Play time!

    // set up event listeners
    this.eventsListen()

    // start State Machine 
    // stateMachineConfig.context = this
    // this.#mediator.stateMachine = stateMachineConfig
    // this.#mediator.stateMachine.start()
  }

  // required
  end() {
    // Stop and clean up the module to prevent memory leaks.
    // It should remove: event listeners, timers, ect.
    // Put your toys away or it will end in tears.
  }



  // recommended
  on(topic, handler, context) {
    this.#mediator.on(topic, handler, context)
  }

  // recommended
  off(topic, handler) {
    this.#mediator.off(topic, handler)
  }

  // recommended
  emit(topic, data) {
    this.#mediator.emit(topic, data)
  }
}

```
