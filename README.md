## WIP - under heavy development

TradeX-chart is a trade chart written in plain (vanilla) JavaScript with minimal dependencies; use it with any framework or backend.

It uses an event driven state managed architecture, providing a two way API to give you complete control over the chart.

## Why

TradeX-chart was created to give you the developer the freedom to choose your framework and not lock you in.

Secondly after talking to other developers, top on their wishlist for a trading chart was more direct control over it, so they could create their own custom plots. The extensive API will give you power over your chart data like you never had before. Subscribe to the internal events messaging to trigger events in your own application.

## Getting Started

TradeX-chart targets browsers that support [ECMAScript 2022](https://www.ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-262_13th_edition_june_2022.pdfhttps:/).

<div id="myChartDiv"></div>

<script>

import {Chart, DOM} from 'tradex-chart'
import * as talib from "talib-web"

// minimal data state
let state = {
  "ohlcv": [
// [timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume]
    [1543579200000,4035.6,4072.78348726,3965,4055.6,2157.50135341],
    [1543582800000,4055.6,4100,4035,4059.1719252,1660.6115119],

  ]
}

// or use document.getElementById('myChartDiv')
const mount = DOM.findBySelector('#myChartDiv')

// minimal config
const config = {
  id: "TradeX_test",
  title: "BTC/USDT",
  width: 1000,
  height: 800,
  utils: {none: true},
  tools: {none: true},
  talib: talib,
  rangeLimit: 30,
}

const chart = Chart.create(mount, config, state )
chart.start(chart.getModID())

</script>
```
